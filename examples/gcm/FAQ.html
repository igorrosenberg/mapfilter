  <DT>The Following Events Had Addresses (Where) That Could Not Be Found</DT>
  <DD>GCM relies on the &ldquo;where&rdquo; field found in the google calendar which has been specified. 
The value of this &ldquo;where&rdquo; field is converted into a latitude and longitude using Google's geolocation API; 
the conversion sometimes may fail for various reasons, but most usually it is because the where data is incomplete. 
To make sure the data is sufficient, copy and paste the &ldquo;where&rdquo; field into 
<a href="http://maps.google.com/">google maps</a>. If a single location is returned, then the data is correct.

<DT>What is GCM?</DT>
<DD>
Google Calendar Map (GCM) puts all events with a location from a google 
calendar on to a google map. The map is a filter, so you can zoom in and move 
the map around to only view events that occur on the map as you see it. 
Additionally, you can use the date sliders to further filter events.

In the Google Calendar interface, locate "My Calendars" or "Other Calendars" 
lists on the left.
Hover over the desired calendar, and click on the arrow that appears. 
A menu will appear.
Click on "Calendar settings"
Look at the "Calendar Address" section of the screen, 
near the XML, ICAL, HTML icons.
Copy the string after "Calendar ID:" - it may be your email,
