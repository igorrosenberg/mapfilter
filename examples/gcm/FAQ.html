  <DT>The Following Events Had Addresses (Where) That Could Not Be Found</DT>
  <DD>GCM relies on the &ldquo;where&rdquo; field found in the google calendar which has been specified. 
The value of this &ldquo;where&rdquo; field is converted into a latitude and longitude using Google's geolocation API; 
the conversion sometimes may fail for various reasons, but most usually it is because the where data is incomplete. 
To make sure the data is sufficient, copy and paste the &ldquo;where&rdquo; field into 
<a href="http://maps.google.com/">google maps</a>. If a single location is returned, then the data is correct.

  <DT>How do I make it Go?</DT>
  <DD>
		First, make your calendar public (if it ain't your calendar, ask owner to do it):
		<ol>
			<li> In the Google Calendar interface, locate "My Calendars" or "Other Calendars" lists on the left.</li>
			<li> Hover over desired calendar, and click the arrow the appears. A menu will appear.</li>
			<li> Click "Share this calendar"</li>
			<li> Check "Make this calendar public"</li>
			<li> Make sure "Share only my free/busy information" is unchecked.</li>
			<li> Click "Save"</li>
		</ol>
		Second, find your Calendar's ID:
		<ol>
			<li> In the Google Calendar interface, locate "My Calendars" or "Other Calendars" lists on the left.</li>
			<li> Hover over desired calendar, and click the arrow the appears. A menu will appear.</li>
			<li> Click "Calendar settings"</li>
			<li> Look at the "Calendar Address" section of the screen, near XML, ICAL, HTML icons. </li>
			<li> Copy string after "Calendar ID:" - it may be your email, or may look like vf3u7s6odj0r74q4lrnb730phk@group.calendar.google.com</li>
			<li> NOTE: the calendar ID can also be extracted from the XML Feed.  For example, xxxx@group.calendar.google.com is the id for this XML Feed: 
				https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/xxxx@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic</li>
		</ol>
		Lastly, Paste the Google Calendar ID in the box above.  Optionally add more Calendar IDs, separated by spaces. Click "Add Calendar" .. you're off!
